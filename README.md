# My TV App application

Proof of concept aimed at putting into practice an e2e development cycle for an application.

> :bulb: Monorepo-like project in which services can be deployed and run independently. Feel free to add any improvements or suggestions you consider.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals

-   Create an application that displays **trending films and TV shows** in two rails.
-   Integrate the **The Movie DB API (TMDB)** to the application.
-   Implement a CI/CD process using **GitHub Actions, Docker, and a Cloud application hosting service.**

    #### The movie DB API:

    In order to implement the solution, we are required to sign up [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/), and also **integrate it to our back-end** then, we will be able to use their API services. For further details, check the specs here [TMDB API specs](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started).

### Considerations

Please, check this considerations out.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
- The architecture is a **mono repo-like project** that uses **workspaces to share type definitions among the app's tiers**.
- The application can be either **started locally or containerized**.
- Each app tier, within the project, can be started for development **independently from the others**.

### Installation and running the project

The project requires:

-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

**Clone the repository:**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/christianjtr/tv-app.git
```

**Scripts:**

Prior to execute these scripts, you must to run **npm install** in the directory you just downloaded/cloned the codebase.

```shell
# Run the entire develepoment environment for both client and server tiers
> npm run dev:app

# Run dev environment for the client-side
> npm run dev:client

# Run develepoment environment for the server-side
> npm run dev:server

# Run unit tests for the client-side tier
> npm run test:client

# Run e2e tests for the client-side tier
> npm run test:client:cy

# Run unit tests for the server-side tier
> npm run test:server

# Build shared types across the application
> npm run build:shared-types

# Perform docker compose to containerize and run the application
> npm run dev:docker:build-up
```

**Environment variables:**

Each app's tier within the project has its own environment variables file, you **should create a .env file following the templates provided** in the correspondant directory.

| Tier   | template     | directory | environment file to create |
| ------ | ------------ | --------- | -------------------------- |
| client | .env.local   | /app      | .env                       |
| server | .env.example | /server   | .env                       |
